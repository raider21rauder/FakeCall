**An open-source Android application to simulate incoming calls, featuring a modern Material 3 UI with dynamic Monet support.**

</div>

## Overview

This is my Fake Call application. Unlike other apps that merely mock a UI, this app integrates directly with the Android Telecom Framework to provide an indistinguishable calling experience. It has many features to make the call as real as possible.

## Features

</p>

-  **Original Dialer:** FakeCall uses your real Phone app to simulate the incoming Call by creating [a Phone Account in android's TelecomManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telecom/TelecomManager)
-  **Customizable:** The app lets you customize the name of the fake phone account in the settings to match your real service provider
-  **Audio Support:** You can upload audio files that play when the call is answered
-  **Call History:** Simulated calls are being shown in call history

##  Development

### Available Gradle Tasks

You can run various Gradle tasks directly from Android Studio (via the Gradle tool window) or from your terminal using `./gradlew` (or `gradlew.bat` on Windows).

| Command                  | Description                                            |

| :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |

| `./gradlew build`        | Assembles and checks all project components.           |

| `./gradlew clean`        | Deletes the build directory.                           |

| `./gradlew installDebug` | Installs the debug APK on a connected device/emulator. |

| `./gradlew lint`         | Runs Android Lint checks.                              |

| `./gradlew test`         | Runs unit tests.                                       |

| `./gradlew assembleRelease` | Assembles the release APK.                            |

### Development Workflow

1.  Open the project in Android Studio.
2.  Make changes to the Kotlin source code, XML resources, or Compose UI files within the `app/src/main` directory.
3.  Use the `Run` button in Android Studio to quickly deploy and test changes on a connected device or emulator.
4.  Utilize the Gradle tool window for specific build tasks, dependency management, and running tests.

##  Testing

The project is expected to follow standard Android testing practices.

### Unit Tests
Unit tests are typically written in Kotlin and located under `app/src/test`. They can be run quickly without an emulator.
```bash
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
```

### UI Tests (Instrumentation Tests)
UI tests for Android (instrumentation tests) are typically written in Kotlin and located under `app/src/androidTest`. These tests require a device or emulator to run.
```bash
./gradlew connectedCheck
```
